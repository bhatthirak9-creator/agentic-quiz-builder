The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. While the total mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant, its distribution among reservoirs like ice, fresh water, saline water, and atmospheric water varies. The cycle is driven by the sun, which heats water in oceans and seas, causing evaporation. Water also enters the atmosphere through transpiration from plants and sublimation from ice. As water vapor rises, it cools and condenses into clouds. Eventually, water falls back to Earth as precipitation (rain or snow), where it may accumulate in ice caps, flow as surface runoff into rivers and oceans, or infiltrate the ground to become groundwater.
